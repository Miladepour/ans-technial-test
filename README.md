# ANS Developer Technical Test

## Description

### Application Overview
This application is designed to deliver up-to-date currency information and conversion capabilities. It is built with two primary views:

### Currency List View
This view offers a comprehensive overview of various currencies, displaying the currency code and the most recent market price. The prices are presented with the currency symbol for immediate and clear recognition.

### Currency Conversion View
This view enables effortless conversions of amounts between different currencies. The interface is user-friendly, facilitating quick calculations for those in need of currency conversion on-the-go.

### Navigation
A simple and intuitive interface, powered by React Router, provides smooth and responsive navigation. Users can switch between views without page reloads, thanks to seamless linking.

### Note
Please note that I prepared the document before starting the test to save time.
